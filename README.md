# Sefaria-iOS
This repo contains the source code and export script to generate the content for Sefaria's unreleased iOS App. 

It is in its earliest stages at this juncture with lots of known bugs, and poorly structured code harnessing React Native, but does (mostly) load the Sefaria Library of texts and present the links on each portion of text.
